# tts-nodejs-python
This is just a short nodejs project. Used for TTS. Text to Speech.

I got the idea yesterday when in an interview, the interviewer asked me if we could execute Python scripts from node. And I said yes we can because I knew that there were ways. But what did not know was, what the ways were. So after the interview, I decided to research about this a bit and build a quick short express application with Python. And the first thing that came to my mind about what to do with Python was TTS. I don't really know why but that was the first thing that came to my mind and so I started on this today and alhamdulillah I'm also done more or less. I have implemented everything I wanted to. And I'm feeling very good that I could do it without any issues. My node and express knowledge is better than I really thought! 

The only other thing that I want to add or modify rather, in this app is, using spawn instead of python-shell. Apparently, spawn is better at processing Python and it is faster with node.
So, the next thing to do in the project will be, to add and integrate spawn in place of python-shell.
